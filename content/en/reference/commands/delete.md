    delete command

## Command
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "delete" "Usage" false -->
Usage: kluctl delete

Delete a target (or parts of it) from the corresponding cluster

Objects are located based on 'commonLabels‚Äù, configured in 'deployment.yml'

WARNING: This command will also delete objects which are not part of your deployment project (anymore). It really only
decides based on the 'deleteByLabel' labels and does NOT take the local target/state into account!
