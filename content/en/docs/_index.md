Kluctl is the missing glue that puts together your (and any third-party) deployments into one large declarative
Kubernetes deployment, while making it fully manageable (deploy, diff, prune, delete, ...) via one unified command
line interface.

Kluctl tries to be as flexible as possible, while remaining as simple as possible. It reuses established
tools (e.g. kustomize and Helm), making it possible to re-use a large set of available third-party deployments.

Kluctl does not depend on external operators/controllers and allows to use the same deployment wherever you want,
as long as access to the kluctl project and clusters is available. This means, that you can use it from your 
local machine, from your CI/CD pipelines or any automation platform/system that allows to call custom tools.

Flux support is in development and will come soon.

## Kluctl in Short

<!-- borrowed from ./content/en/_index.html -->

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 💪 Kluctl handles all your deployments | You can manage all your deployments with Kluctl, including infrastructure related and your applications. |
| 🪶 Complex or simple, all the same | You can manage complex and simple deployments with Kluctl. Simple deployments are lightweight while complex deployment are easily manageable. |
| 🤖 Native git support | Kluctl has native Git support integrated, meaning that it can easily deploy remote Kluctl projects or externalize parts (e.g. cluster configs) of your Kluctl project. |
| 🪐 Multiple environments | Deploy the same deployment to multiple environments (dev, test, prod, ...), with flexible differences in configuration. |
| 🌌 Multiple clusters | Manage multiple target clusters (in multiple clouds or bare-metal if you want). |
| 🔩 Configuration and Templating | Kluctl allows to use templating in nearly all places, making it easy to have dynamic configuration. |
| ⎈ Helm and Kustomize | The Helm and Kustomize integrations allow you to reuse plenty of third-party charts and kustomizations. |
| 🔍 See what's different | Always know what the state of your deployments is by being able to run diffs on the whole deployment. |
| 🔎 See what happened | Always know what you actually changed after performing a deployment. |
| 💥 Know what went wrong | Kluctl will show you what part of your deployment failed and why. |
| 👐 Live and let live | Kluctl tries to not interfere with any other tools or operators. This is possible due to it's use of server-side-apply. |
| 🧹 Keep it clean | Keep your clusters clean by issuing regular prune calls. |
| 🔐 Encrypted Secrets | Manage encrypted secrets for multiple target environments and clusters. |

## What can I do with Kluctl?

Kluctl allows you to define a Kluctl project, which in turn defines Kluctl
deployments and sub-deployments. Each Kluctl deployment defines Kustomize deployments.

A Kluctl project also defines targets, which represent your target environments
and/or clusters.

The Kluctl CLI then allows to deploy, diff, prune, delete, ... your deployments.
