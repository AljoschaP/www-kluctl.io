## Command
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "delete" "Usage" false -->
Usage: kluctl delete [flags]

Delete a target (or parts of it) from the corresponding cluster
Objects are located based on 'commonLabels'', configured in 'deployment.yml'

WARNING: This command will also delete objects which are not part of your deployment
project (anymore). It really only decides based on the 'deleteByLabel' labels and does NOT
take the local target/state into account!
