## Command
<!-- BEGIN SECTION "diff" "Usage" false -->
Usage: kluctl diff [flags]

Perform a diff between the locally rendered target and the already deployed target
The output is by default in human readable form (a table combined with unified diffs).
The output can also be changed to output a yaml file. Please note however that the format
is currently not documented and prone to changes.
After the diff is performed, the command will also search for prunable objects and list them.
